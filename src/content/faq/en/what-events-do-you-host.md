We host a variety of events every two weeks, including:

- **Beginner-friendly workshops** - Learn new programming languages, tools, or frameworks
- **Practical coding sessions** - Work on projects together or get help with your own
- **Tech talks** - Hear from community members about their experiences and projects
- **Social events** - Network and connect with others in a relaxed setting
- **Co-working evenings** - Code alongside others in a supportive environment

All events are held in English. Some focus on learning specific skills, while others are simply about connecting with the community. You're welcome to attend as often as you like!
