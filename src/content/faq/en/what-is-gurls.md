G:URL*s is a coding club for the FLINTA* community in Vienna. We're open to anyone interested in learning or improving their programming skills, regardless of experience level. We host biweekly events in English that range from beginner-friendly workshops and tech talks to social events and co-working sessions.

Our mission is to create an inclusive, supportive space where people can grow their tech skills, connect with others, and explore coding in a welcoming environment.
